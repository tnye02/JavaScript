# JavaScript Projects
A list of the projects I've done in the JavaScript Course for The Tech Academy

## Projects:

1. Calculator
2. Tic-Tac-D'OH
3. Pizza Menu
4. Final Project

### Calculator - 
A simple calculator that can add, subtract, divide and multiply, as one would expect.

### Tic-Tac-D'OH Game
Traditional Tic-Tac-Toe with the x's and o's replaced by Homer Simpson and his arch enemy Ned Flanders, with Homer's famous sound effects

### Pizza Menu
A simple pizza ordering menu that requests the size of the pizza, allows you to choose toppings then returns the price to you.

### Final Project
Added a small slide show element displaying some of the things i'm interested in. I also added a contact button that sits at the bottom of the page no matter where the user scrolls that when clicked opens the contact form. This form also appears when the contact button in the navigation bar is clicked.
